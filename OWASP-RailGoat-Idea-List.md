# Your Idea

## Brief Explanation of Idea
RailsGoat is a great framework for learning about OWASP Top 10 2013 using 
a vulnerable version of the Ruby on Rails (versions 3 to 5), as well as 
some "extras" that the initial project contributors felt worthwhile to 
share. This project is designed to educate both developers, as well as 
security professionals. Feel free to check out the
[Railsgoat Github site](https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat)
for more details. 
If you have an idea that is not on this list then don't worry, you can still submit it.

## Expected Results for Idea
 * Wonderful experience for Student Developers, Mentors, and Technical Advisors
 * A new feature that makes RailsGoat even better
 * Code that conforms to our Development Rules and Guidelines

## Idea Needs
 * Student Developers

## Getting Started
 * Have a look at the RailsGoat https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat/blob/master/README.md file, especially the 'Getting Started' section. We like to see student developers who have already contributed to RailsGoat, so try fixing one of the bugs.

## Knowledge Prerequisite
 * RailsGoat is written in Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails, so a good knowledge of this language ecosystem is recommended. Some knowledge of application security would be useful, but not essential.

## Mentors
 * [Frank Rietta](frank@rietta.com) - OWASP RailsGoat Mentor
 * [Ken Johnson](ken.johnson@owasp.org) - OWASP RailsGoat "Technical Advisor, potentially mentor"
 * [Al Snow](jasnow@hotmail.com) - OWASP RailsGoat Project Coordinator
