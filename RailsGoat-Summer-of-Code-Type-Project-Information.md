**3/24/2018: STUDENTS: Please do not forget and do not hesitate to upload a final copy of the proposal (in PDF format) ASAP.
Later you can upload another modified final proposal, if needed, and it will override the first one.
So, a final proposal is not final yet, until the submission time expires (on March 27).
If you have not submitted a final proposal yet by that time (March 27), you
will be automatically disqualified by the GSOC system.**

# Students Getting Started with RailsGoat SOC Initiative
 1. We really appreciate your interest in the RailsGoat SOC Initiative.
   As Google has open up the GSOC student proposal
   submit time-period (**March 12-27, 1018**), we encouraged you to read up about the
   RailsGoat SOC Initiative on this wiki page and follow the links under [OWASP/GSOC 2018 Initiative](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSoC).
 1. We see that OWASP applied to GSOC 2018 and has been selected. We do not know yet how many students "slots" Google will give OWASP or if we will get any of the given slots.
 1. We hope to be a part of the OWASP GSOC Initiative and currently working to staff the ideas listed below with mentors.
 1. Start thinking about the project "idea" or ideas you want to work on.
   You can pick one of the ones listed at the end of this page: [OWASP/GSOC Project Ideas](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/GSOC2018_Ideas) or come up with one yourself. You will be creating a proposal based on the"idea" and submitting it to Google between March 12-27, 2018.
 1. Here is your OWASP Slack invite: https://owasp.herokuapp.com . Introduce yourself in the [RailsGoat Slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fproject-railsgoat). Feel free to ask questions in the [RailsGoat Slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fproject-railsgoat).
 1. Get involve in RailsGoat community. Comment on a RailsGoat issue or submit a RailsGoat Pull Request.
 1. **Suggestion for First Issues:**
I would suggest that while you are setting up your RailsGoat
environment and reading the RailsGoat repo's documentation that
you write up things (one thing per ticket) that are confusing or
out-of-date. Then we can work them one-by-one to improve the
initial experience of working with this project.
Also remember to work on your "GSOC Student Application/Proposal"
if you want be be officially part of GSOC 2018. You can add
comments/questions/show interest to any GitHub issue with a GSOC tag.
